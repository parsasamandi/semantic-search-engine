Cloud Computing and DevOps

Cloud computing has transformed how organizations build and deploy applications. Instead of managing physical servers, developers can access computing resources on-demand through the internet, paying only for what they use.

Major Cloud Providers dominate the market:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers the most comprehensive suite of services
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) excels in data analytics and machine learning
- Microsoft Azure integrates seamlessly with enterprise Microsoft products

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtual machines, storage, and networking. Developers have full control over the operating system and applications. Platform as a Service (PaaS) abstracts infrastructure management, letting developers focus solely on code. Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers complete applications over the internet.

DevOps practices bridge development and operations, emphasizing automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and infrastructure as code. Tools like Docker containerize applications for consistency across environments, while Kubernetes orchestrates container deployments at scale.

Cloud-native architectures leverage microservices, serverless functions, and managed services to build scalable, resilient applications. Monitoring, logging, and security remain critical concerns, with tools like CloudWatch, Prometheus, and various security scanning services helping maintain system health.
