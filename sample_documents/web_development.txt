Modern Web Development

Web development has evolved tremendously over the past decade. Today's web applications are sophisticated, interactive experiences that rival native desktop applications in functionality and user experience.

Frontend Development focuses on what users see and interact with. The foundation consists of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Modern frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular have revolutionized frontend development by introducing component-based architectures, virtual DOMs, and reactive state management.

Backend Development powers the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that frontend applications rely on. Popular choices include Node.js with Express, Python with Django or FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, and PHP with Laravel. These frameworks handle business logic, authentication, data validation, and database operations.

Full-stack development combines both frontend and backend skills. Modern full-stack developers often work with JavaScript across the entire stack (Node.js backend, React frontend), creating efficient development workflows.

Key concepts include RESTful APIs, responsive design, progressive web apps, serverless architecture, microservices, and DevOps practices. Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure have made deployment and scaling more accessible than ever.
