Cybersecurity Fundamentals

Cybersecurity protects computer systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. As our world becomes increasingly connected, security has become paramount for organizations and individuals alike.

Common Threats include malware (viruses, ransomware, spyware), phishing attacks that trick users into revealing sensitive information, SQL injection that exploits database vulnerabilities, cross-site scripting (XSS) that injects malicious code into websites, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm systems.

Defense Strategies employ multiple layers:
- Authentication and Authorization: Multi-factor authentication, strong password policies, and role-based access control
- Encryption: Protecting data in transit (TLS/SSL) and at rest (AES encryption)
- Network Security: Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and VPNs
- Security Testing: Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- Security Awareness: Training users to recognize social engineering attacks

Best Practices for developers include input validation, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, secure session management, regular security updates, and following principles like least privilege and defense in depth.

Compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS mandate security measures for organizations handling sensitive data. Security certifications (CISSP, CEH, Security+) validate professional expertise in the field.
